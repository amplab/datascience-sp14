      "\n",
      "Today, we'll learn how to use [Spark](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/), a framework for large-scale data processing.  All of the frameworks that we've used so far (e.g., [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), R) are designed to be run on a single computer.  However, many data sets today are too large to be stored on a single computer.  Even when a dataset can be stored on one computer, the data set can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.  Spark is designed for this purpose: it allows you to concisely describe a program to analyze data on many computers, and hides many of the details of coordinating data analysis on many machines.\n",

Let's look at what happens when we do a basic operation on the dataset.  One of the most basic jobs that we can run is the `count()` job that we ran earlier.  When you run `count()` on a dataset, a single *stage* of tasks is launched.  A *stage* is a group of tasks that all perform the same computation, but on different input data.  One task is launched for each partitition, as shown in the example below.  A task is a unit of execution that runs on a single machine.  In this example, the dataset is broken into 4 partitions, so 4 `count()` tasks are launched.\n",

      "Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the data set\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can easily parallelize the operation: each task does the \"something\" to it's own partition of the dataset. `map(f)` is one such example: it applies a function `f` to each item in the dataset, and outputs the resulting dataset.  When we run `map(f)` with Spark, each task applies `f` to all of the entries in a particular partition, and outputs a new partition.  We'll use `map(f)` to convert the ratings dataset to a format that's a little easier to manipulate.  Having \"`::`\"-separated strings for each data item is not very convenient; let's convert the input data into tuples: `(UserID, MovieID, Rating, Timestamp)`, and convert the IDs, ratings, and timestamps to appropriate data types.  The figure below shows how this would work on the smaller data set from the earlier figures.  Note that one task is launched for each partition.\n",

Finally, we call `map()` to add up all of the values for each key.

      "So far, we've used `groupByKey()` when we want to combine all of the values for a particular key.  Recall that `groupByKey()` collects all of the values for each key in one dataset.  Then, we used a subsequent `map()` call to aggregate all of the values.  However, this isn't very efficient; often, we don't need all of the values at once.  Instead, we can often use incrementally *reduce* the set of values for each key.  We do this by specifying a function `f` that takes two values and combines them, and calling `reduceByKey(f)` instead of `groupByKey()`. Spark keeps using `f` to combine pairs of values for the same key until there is only 1 value left for each key.  Because Spark can incrementally combine pairs of values for a particular key, so that it never has to store all of the values for a key at one time.  Let's use `reduceByKey` to more efficiently count the number of ratings with each ratings value."

The difference between `reduce` and `reduceByKey` is that reduce combines *all* of the entries in a particular dataset -- not just the entries for a particular key.  `reduce` will return a single value, whereas `reduceByKey` returns a new RDD with one entry for each key.

      "\n",
      "The UI for the Spark master is on port 8080, and the hostname is stored as part of the `CLUSTER_URL` variable pre-loaded into this notebook.  From the master UI, you can find the link to your application's UI.\n",

      "### What are all of the operations I can do on a Spark dataset (RDD)?\n",
      "\n",
      "[This Page](http://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/api/pyspark/index.html) lists all of the operations you can do on a Spark RDD.  Spark also has a Scala API (Scala is a programming language similar to Java); the [documentation for the Scala functions](http://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/scala-programming-guide.html) is sometimes more helpful, and the Python functions work in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How do I use matplotlib?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of good examples on the [matplotlib website](http://matplotlib.org/index.html).  For example, [this page](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/simple_plot.html) shows how to plot a single line.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why am I getting an OutOfMemoryError?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you get an error that looks like: `org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted: Exception while deserializing and fetching task: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`, it probably means that you've tried to collect too much data on the machine where Python is running.  This is likely to happen if you do `collect()` on a large dataset.  The best way to remedy this problem is to restart your iPython notebook (go to the main server, at port 8888 of the machine you were assigned, click \"Shutdown\" on your notebook, and then open it again) and don't do `collect()` on a large dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious why you're getting a Java error when your program is written in Python?  Spark is mostly written in Java (and Scala, a language built on top of Java).  We're using `pyspark` here, which uses a translation layer to translate between Python and Java.  Your Python `SparkContext` object is backed by a Java `SparkContext` object; all operations you run on Spark datasets are passsed through this Java object.  So, if you try to collect a result that's too large, the Java Virtual Machine that's running the Java `SparkContext` runs out of memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Python / Spark is giving me a crazy weird error!\n",
      "\n",
      "Spark is mostly written in Scala and Java, and the Python version of the code (\"pyspark\") hooks into the Java implementation in a way that can make error messages very difficult to understand.  If you get a hard-to-understand error when you run a Spark operation, we recommend first narrowing down the error so that you know exactly which operation caused the error.  For example, if `rdd.groupByKey().map(lambda x: x[1])` fails with an error, separate the `groupByKey()` and `map()` calls onto separate lines so you know which one is causing the error.  Next, double check the function signature to make sure you're passing the right arguments.  Pyspark can fail with a weird error if a RDD operation is given the wrong number or type of arguments.  If you're still stumped, try using `take(10)` to print out the first 10 entries in the dataset you're calling the RDD operation on.  Make sure the function you're calling and the arguments you're passing in make sense given the format of the input dataset.\n",
