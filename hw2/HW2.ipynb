We will use a real world music dataset from [Last.fm](http://last.fm) for this assignment. There are two parts to this assignment: In the first part we will look at Unsupervised Learning with clustering and in the second part, we will study Supervised Learning. The play data (and user/artist matrix) comes from the [Last.fm 1K Users dataset](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-1K.html), while the tags come from [the Last.fm Music Tags dataset](http://musicmachinery.com/2010/11/10/lastfm-artisttags2007/). You won't have to interact with these datasets directly, because we've already preprocessed them for you.\n",

There are many approaches to unsupervised learning which includes topics like Clustering,  Mixture Models, Hidden Markov Models etc. In this assignment we will predominantly look at clustering.\n",
      "2. Supervised Learning - we have training data which is labeled (either manually or from historical data) and we try to make predictions about those labels on new, unlabeled, data. There are similarly several approaches to supervised learning - various classification and regression techniques all the way up to Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks. In this assignment we'll explore two regression algorithms - Least Squares Linear Regression and Regression Trees. \n",

The goal of linear modeling, is to fit a **linear equation** that maps a set of **input features** to a numerical **response**. This equation is called a **model**, and can be used to make predictions about the response of similar input features. For example, imagine we have a dataset of electricity prices ($p$) and outdoor temperature ($t$), and we want to predict, given temperature, what electricity price will be. A simple way to model this is with an equation that looks something like $p = basePrice + factor*t$. When we **fit** a model, we are estimating the parameters ($basePrice$ and $factor$) that best fit our data. This is a very simple linear model, but you can easily imagine extending this to situations where you need to estimate several parameters.\n",

      "\n",
      "Linear models expect **numbers** for input features. But we have some features that we think could be useful that are **discrete** or **categorical**. How do we represent these as numbers?\n",
      "\n",
      "One solution is something called one-hot encoding. Basically, we map a discrete space to a vector of binary indicators, then use these indicators as numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if I had an input column that could take on the values {$RED$, $GREEN$, $BLUE$}, and I wanted to model this with one-hot-encoding, I could use a map:\n",
      "\n",
      "* $RED = 001$\n",
      "* $GREEN = 010$\n",
      "* $BLUE = 100$\n",
      "\n",
      "We use this representation instead of traditional binary numbers to keep these features independent of one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we've established this representation, we replace the columns in our dataset with their one-hot-encoded values. Then, we can fit a linear model on the data once it's encoded this way!\n",
      "\n",
      "Statisticians and econometricians call these types of binary variables *dummy variables*, but we're going to call it one-hot encoding, because that sounds cooler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scikit-learn has functionality to transform values to this encoding built in, so we'll leverage that. The functionality is called `DictVectorizer` in scikit-learn. The idea is that you feed a `DictVectorizer` a bunch of examples of your data (that's the `vec.fit` line), and it builds a map from a categorical variable to a one-hot encoded vector like we have in the color example above. Then, you can use this object to translate from categorical values to sequences of numeric ones as we do with `vec.transform`. In the example below, we fit a vectorizer on the training data and use the same vectorizer on the validation data so that the mapping is consistent and we don't run into issues if the categories don't match perfectly between the two data sets.\n",
